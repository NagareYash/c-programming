This lab introduces fundamental data types in C, how to declare and use variables, perform input/output operations, and control program flow using conditional statements and loops.
## Data Types

C provides several fundamental data types for storing different kinds of values. Each data type has a specific size, range of values it can hold, and a format specifier used with `printf()` and `scanf()`

|   Data Type   | Size (bytes) |                          Range                          | Format Specifier |
| :-----------: | :----------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|     char      |      1       |                       -128 to 127                       |        %c        |
|      int      |      4       |             -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647             |        %d        |
|     long      |      8       | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |       %ld        |
|     float     |      4       |                  -3.4e+38 to +3.4e+38                   |        %f        |
|    double     |      8       |                 -1.7e+308 to +1.7e+308                  |       %lf        |
| unsigned char |      1       |                        0 to 255                         |        %c        |
| unsigned int  |      4       |                   0 to 4,294,967,295                    |        %u        |
| unsigned long |      8       |             0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615             |       %lu        |
## Variable Declarations

A variable is a named storage location in computer memory that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled container where you can store data. Variables allow programs to remember and manipulate information.
### Syntax

```c
data_type variable_name;
```

A variable must be declared before it can be used. Declaration tells the compiler what type of data the variable will store and reserves memory for it.

### Example

**Single Variable Declaration:**
```c
int age;                    // Declares an integer variable
float price;                // Declares a floating-point variable
char grade;                 // Declares a character variable
double distance;            // Declares a double variable
```

**Multiple Variables of Same Type:**
```c
int a, b, c;                        // Three integers
float x, y, z;                      // Three floats
char letter, symbol, digit;         // Three characters
```

**Declaration with Initialization:**
```c
int age = 25;                       // Declare and assign value
float pi = 3.14159;                 // Initialize with decimal
char grade = 'A';                   // Initialize with character
double large = 1.5e8;               // Scientific notation
```

**Multiple Declarations with Values:**
```c
int a = 7, b = 4000, c = -44;              // Three integers with values
float x = 22.787, y = 2.3e-4, z = 7.777e3; // Three floats with values
```

**String (Character Array) Declaration:**
```c
char name[20];                      // String with space for 20 characters
char message[] = "Hello";           // Size determined automatically
char greeting[50] = "Welcome";      // Partially filled array
```

### Do's and Don'ts
#### DO:
1. Declare variables at the beginning of your function​
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Initialize variables when declaring them
4. Follow naming conventions (like camelCase, snake_case, UPPER_CASE for constants)
5. Use local variables (inside functions)
#### Don'ts:
1. Don't start variable names with numbers
2. Don't use special characters (except underscore)
3. Don't use C keywords as variable names
4. Don't use single-letter or cryptic names
5. Don't forget that C is case-sensitive
6. Don't use uninitialized variables
7. Don't overuse global variables​
8. Don't declare the same variable twice in the same scope
9. Don't forget null terminator space for strings
## Input and Output

Input/Output (I/O) allows your program to interact with users. **Input** means reading data from the user (keyboard), and **Output** means displaying data to the user (screen).

C provides two main functions for basic I/O:​
- `printf()` - for output (printing to screen)
- `scanf()` - for input (reading from keyboard)

Both functions require the `<stdio.h>` header file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

### Printf()
`printf()` stands for "print formatted". It displays formatted text and variable values on the screen.
#### Syntax
```c
printf("format string", variable1, variable2, ...);
```
#### Example
```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");
printf("Age: %d\n", age);
printf("Age: %d, Grade: %c, GPA: %.2f\n", age, grade, gpa);
```

### Scanf()
`scanf()` stands for "scan formatted". It reads formatted input from the keyboard and stores it in variables.
#### Syntax
```c
scanf("format string", &variable1, &variable2, ...);
```
#### Why Use & (Address-of Operator)?
The `&` gives `scanf()` the memory address where it should store the input value. Without `&`, `scanf()` won't work properly.

```c
int age;
scanf("%d", &age);      // Correct - using &
scanf("%d", age);       // Wrong - missing &
```

#### Example
```c
// Program to take age as input and print it as output
int age;
printf("Enter your age: ");
scanf("%d", &age);
printf("Your age is %d\n", age);
```
## Problem 1
Write a C program that asks the user to enter their name, age, and GPA separately, then displays all the information together on one line. Declare a character array `name[50]` to store the name, an integer variable for age, and a float variable for GPA. The output should look like this: "Student Information: Name: John, Age: 20, GPA: 3.85".

**Expected Output**:
```shell
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter age: 20
Enter GPA: 3.85

Student Information: Name: John Doe, Age: 20, GPA: 3.85
```

*After your program works correctly, try an experiment. Change the age variable from `int age;` to `char age;` and run the program again. What happens when you enter a two-digit number like 20?*
## Operators (arithmetic, relational)
### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations

| Operator |      Name      |          Description          | Example | Results (if a=10, b=3) |
| :------: | :------------: | :---------------------------: | :-----: | :--------------------: |
|    +     |    Addition    |    Adds two or more values    |  a + b  |           13           |
|    -     |  Substraction  |  Subtracts second from first  |  a - b  |           7            |
|    *     | Multiplication | Multiplies two or more values |  a * b  |           30           |
|    /     |    Division    |    Divides first by second    |  a / b  |           3            |
|    %     |    Modulus     |       Returns remainder       |  a % b  |           1            |
|    ++    |   Increment    |     Increases value by 1      |   a++   |           11           |
|    --    |   Decrement    |     Decreases value by 1      |   a--   |           9            |
### Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values and return true (1) or false (0).

| Operator |         Name          |          Description           | Example | Results (if a=10, b=3) |
| :------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------------: | :-----: | :--------------------: |
|    ==    |       Equal to        |   Checks if values are equal   | a == b  |       0 (false)        |
|    !=    |     Not equal to      | Checks if values are different | a != b  |        1 (true)        |
|    >     |     Greater than      |     Checks if left > right     |  a > b  |        1 (true)        |
|    <     |       Less than       |     Checks if left < right     |  a < b  |       0 (false)        |
|    >=    | Greater than or equal |     Checks if left ≥ right     | a >= b  |        1 (true)        |
|    <=    |  Less than or equal   |     Checks if left ≤ right     | a <= b  |       0 (false)        |
## Control Flow ( if, else if, nested if)
Control flow statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different code based on conditions.
### if Statement
The `if` statement executes code only when a condition is true.
#### Syntax
```c
if (condition) {
    // Code executes if condition is true
}
```
#### Flowchart
```text
    Start
      |
   Condition? ----No----> Skip block
      |
     Yes
      |
   Execute code
      |
   Continue
```
#### Example
```c
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You are an adult\n");
}
```
### if-else Statement
The `if-else` statement chooses between two alternatives.​
#### Syntax
```c
if (condition) {
    // Executes if condition is true
} else {
    // Executes if condition is false
}
```
#### Flowchart
```text
    Start
      |
   Condition?
    /    \
  Yes    No
   |      |
Block1  Block2
   \      /
   Continue
```
#### Example
```c
int num = 7;

if (num % 2 == 0) {
    printf("Even number\n");
} else {
    printf("Odd number\n");
}
```
### else-if Statement
The `else-if` statement tests multiple conditions in sequence.​
#### Syntax
```c
if (condition1) {
    // Executes if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Executes if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
} 
.
.
.
.
else {
    // Executes if all conditions are false
}
```
#### Flowchart
```text
       Start
         |
    Condition1? --Yes--> Block1
         |No
    Condition2? --Yes--> Block2
         |No
    Condition3? --Yes--> Block3
         |No
      Block4
         |
      Continue
```
#### Example
```c
int marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
    printf("Grade: A\n");
} else if (marks >= 80) {
    printf("Grade: B\n");
} else if (marks >= 70) {
    printf("Grade: C\n");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
    printf("Grade: D\n");
} else {
    printf("Grade: F\n");
}
```
### Nested if Statement
A nested `if` is an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. The inner condition is only tested if the outer condition is true.​
#### Syntax
```c
if (condition1) {
    // Outer block
    if (condition2) {
        // Inner block - executes if both conditions are true
    }
}
```
#### Example
```c
int age = 20;
int citizenship = 1;  // 1 = citizen, 0 = non-citizen

if (age >= 18) {
    if (citizenship == 1) {
        printf("You can vote\n");
    } else {
        printf("You must be a citizen to vote\n");
    }
} else {
    printf("You must be 18 or older to vote\n");
}
```

## Problem 2
Create a calculator program that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers. Your program should work like this: first, ask the user which operation they want to perform `(type +, -, *, or /)`. Then, ask them to enter two numbers that you'll call `a` and `b`. Use `double` as the data type for both numbers and for storing the answer. When you read the operation symbol, use `%c` in `scanf()` because it's a character. When you read the numbers `a` and `b`, use `%lf` in `scanf()` because they are doubles. When you print the final result, also use `%lf` in `printf()` for double variables. Make sure to check that the user entered one of the four allowed operations. If they choose division, also check that the second number isn't zero (you can't divide by zero!).

**Expected Output**:
```shell
//Case: Addition
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter first number: 15.5
Enter second number: 4.5
Result: 20.000000

//Case: Division by Zero
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter first number: 10.0
Enter second number: 0.0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!

//Case: Invalid Input
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): %
Invalid operation!
```
## Looping Mechanism (for, while, do-while)
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again and again.​
### for Loop
The `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat.
#### Syntax
```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to repeat
}
```
### Flowchart
```text
       Start
         |
   Initialization
         |
    Condition? --No--> Exit loop
         |Yes
    Execute code
         |
      Update
         |
    (Back to Condition)
```
#### Example
```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```
### while Loop
The `while` loop repeats as long as the condition is true. Use it when you don't know how many iterations are needed.
#### Syntax
```c
while (condition) {
    // Code to repeat
}
```
#### Flowchart
```text
       Start
         |
    Condition? --No--> Exit loop
         |Yes
    Execute code
         |
    (Back to Condition)
```
#### Example
```c
int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```
### do-while Loop
The `do-while` loop executes at least once, then checks the condition. The code runs first, _then_ the condition is tested.​
#### Syntax
```c
do {
    // Code to repeat
} while (condition);
```
#### Flowchart
```text
       Start
         |
    Execute code
         |
    Condition? --Yes--> (Back to Execute)
         |No
      Exit loop
```
#### Example
```c
int i = 1;

do {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```
### Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop.
#### Example
```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", i, j, i * j);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

## Practice Tasks
1. Write a C program that asks the user to enter two numbers. Store them in two separate variables (let's call them `a` and `b`). After getting the numbers, swap their values so that the first variable contains the second number and the second variable contains the first number. Finally, print both variables to show that they have been swapped.

2. Write C programs to print the following star patterns using loops: 
```shell
	*
	* *
	* * *
	* * * *
	* * * * *
```

3.  Modify your calculator program from Problem 2 to use a do-while loop so that it keeps running without having to restart the program each time. After performing a calculation and displaying the result, ask the user "Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n)". If the user enters 'y', the program should ask for a new operation and numbers again. If the user enters 'n', the program should display "Thank you for using the calculator!" and stop. This way, users can perform multiple calculations in one run without having to execute the program repeatedly. Use a do-while loop structure where the loop continues as long as the user's choice is 'y'.
```c
//Hint:
char choice;

do {
    // Your calculator code here
    
    printf("\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): ");
    scanf(" %c", &choice);
    
} while (choice == 'y');

printf("Thank you for using the calculator!\n");
```
