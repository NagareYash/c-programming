C is a programming language developed at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the USA in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. It has since become one of the most influential programming languages in computer science, serving as the foundation for many modern languages and operating systems. Understanding C provides a strong foundation for learning other programming languages and understanding how computers work at a fundamental level.
​
There is a close analogy between learning the English language and learning the C language. Just as you must master basic elements before constructing complex expressions in English, you must understand C's building blocks before writing complete programs. This progression is illustrated below:

- Steps in learning english language:
	`Alphabets -> Words -> Sentences -> Paragraph`

- Step in learning C language:
	`Alphabet, Digits, Special Symbol -> Constants, Variables, Keywords -> Instructions -> Program`

## Building blocks of C

### 1. Alphabets, Digits, and Special Symbols

These are the basic characters you use to write C code:
- Alphabets: `A-Z and a-z (C is case-sensitive, so A and a are different)`
- Digits: `0-9`
- Special Symbols: `+, -, *, /, =, ;, {, }, (, ), ", etc`

Each symbol has a specific purpose. For example, ; ends a statement, {} creates code blocks, and () is used for functions.
### 2. Constants, Variables, and Keywords

**Constants** are fixed values that never change, like the number `5` or the text `"Hello"`.

**Variables** are named storage locations that can hold different values. For example, `age` could be a variable that stores a person's age. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, digits, and underscores.

**Keywords** are reserved words with special meanings in C. You cannot use them as variable names. Common keywords include:
- `int` - declares integer variables
- `return` - returns a value from a function
- `void` - means no value
- `if`, `while`, `for` - control program flow

C has 32 keywords total.
### 3. Instructions

Instructions are statements that tell the computer what to do. Every instruction in C ends with a semicolon `;`.

Examples:
- `int age;` - creates a variable
- `age = 25;` - stores a value in a variable
- `printf("Hello");` - displays text on screen

Instructions run one after another in the order you write them.
### 4. Program

A program is a collection of instructions that work together. Every C program needs a `main` function where the program starts running. Programs also include:
- `#include` statements to use library functions
- The `main` function with your code inside
- Instructions that do the actual work

## Your First C Program: Hello, World!
Refer to: [hello_world.c](src/hello_world.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
} 
```

- Line 1:**`#include <stdio.h>`**: This includes the Standard Input/Output library so you can use `printf`.
- Line 3:**`int main(void)`**: This starts the `main` function. Every C program begins here. The `{` marks where the function starts.
- Line 4: **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**: This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. The `\n` creates a new line.
- Line 5: **`return 0;`**: This ends the program. Returning `0` means the program finished successfully.
- Line 6: **`}`**: This marks the end of the `main` function.

When you run this program, you'll see "Hello, World!" on your screen. This program uses all the building blocks: characters, keywords (`int`, `void`, `return`), a constant (`"Hello, World!"`), and instructions organized into a complete program.

## Practice Tasks
Now that you understand the basic structure of a C program, try these exercises to reinforce your learning:

**Task 1: Print Your Name**  
Modify the program to print your name instead of "Hello, World!". For example, if your name is Yash, the output should be:

```bash
Yash
```

**Task 2: Print Multiple Lines**  
Write a program that prints your name on one line and your university name on the next line. Your output should look like:

```bash
Your Name 
Your University
```

_Hint: Use two `printf` statements or use `\n` to create a new line._

**Task 3: Create a Greeting**  
Write a program that prints a greeting message with your name. For example:

```bash
Hello! My name is Yash
Welcome to C programming!
```

**Task 4: Experiment**  
Try removing the semicolon `;` from one of the `printf` statements and compile the program. What error message do you get? Put the semicolon back and make sure your program runs successfully again.
