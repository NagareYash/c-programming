# C Programming Lab
A comprehensive collection of weekly lab materials and resources for undergraduate C programming students.

## 📚 Course Overview
This repository contains lecture notes, lab exercises, and code examples for the C Programming course. Materials are organized by week to follow the semester progression.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Weekly Notes**: Numbered Markdown files (e.g., `0. Introduction...`, `1. Data Types...`) containing the theory for each week.
- **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the lab environment on Mac and Windows.
- **`src/`**: This folder contains all the source code and example C programs used in the labs.

## 📓 Obsidian Support
These notes are written in Markdown. While you can view them directly on GitHub, this repository is fully compatible with **Obsidian**. You can clone the repo and open the folder as an Obsidian Vault for a better reading and linking experience.
